      <h1>FAQs</h1>
      <p><b>What day is the long run?</b> Weekend runs will switch from Saturday to Sunday every three months. Please check the current schedule at the top of the page.</p>
        <p><b>How fast do yall go?</b>Our pace is generally around 9:30-10:30 min miles. However, all levels of experience and all paces are welcome. We pause at the halfway point and make sure no one is left behind. Our weekend runs are 6-13 miles at a 9:30-10:30 pace, and pace varies based on the runners present. Meeting points throughout long run routes ensure folks can choose their own speed and stay with the group. Walking intervals are frequently employed at long runs.</p> 
      <p><b>Where do you meet?</b> We meet at the benches in front of the restrooms by the Astoria Park Track.</p>
